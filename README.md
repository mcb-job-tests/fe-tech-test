# Betting & Gaming Tech Test

This test comes with a mock API and WebSocket server that represents a snapshot of some live football events we offer betting on at Sky Bet.

The challenge is to build a lightweight application to display the events returned by the API and enable users to browse for more details and betting opportunities.

Full details of the API are available [on the docker hub page](https://hub.docker.com/r/sbgtechtest/api/) and further information about terms used, example API responses and the betting domain in general are available in [the background docs](./Background.md)

## The Test

We realise everyone has different levels of skill and experience when it comes to development so we have listed different levels of tasks below for you to choose from. If you do not have the time or the knowledge to complete them all then that's ok, we just want to see how you approach the problem and get a feel for how you code.

The API uses a snapshot of data from a (relatively) recent point in time. As such, the start times for the events are accurate as of the snapshot so can be used for displaying as an absolute value. They should not be used to calculate the amount of time elapsed in a game as they will likely be hugely inaccurate.

### Task One

Using the provided API: 
1. Build an application which displays the currently live Football events. Events are available from the `/football/live` API endpoint.
2. Add an option to show the primary market for each of the events
3. Add a feature to toggle the odds display between fractional and decimal (this should apply globally to any place in the app where odds are shown)

### Task Two

1. Add a feature to allow users to browse for full details for one of the events (this may be a new page or some other mechanic)
    1. Use as much of the detail in the Event response as possible to inform the user of meta data such as event type, start time and scores
2. To save on bandwidth, the event API response will only include outcomes for the first ten markets in an event. Add a feature to lazy load the outcomes for any market that doesn't have outcomes loaded as part of the initial response
3. Enable users to browse to other events directly when viewing an event's details (i.e. not having to navigate via the overview)

### Task Three

1. Connect to the WebSocket server and listen to relevant updates for markets and outcomes.
    1. Use the included images to help understand what `status.suspended` implies for the User.
2. Instead of showing all events in one list for the overview, group them by their `linkedEventTypeName` property. A missing value should cause the grouping to fall back to the `typeName` property.
    1. Additionally, anywhere you are displaying full details of an event, where possible use the `linkedEventTypeName` to highlight the competition the event belongs to.
3. Add support for displaying markets with different types (i.e. `win-draw-win` and `correct-score`) with more appropriate layouts. (See the [live website](https://m.skybet.com) for inspiration.)
4. Support "deep linking" of events (i.e. enable a user to browse directly to full details for an event instead of requiring them to navigate from the overview list)

## Languages

This is a "client side" focused test so the end deliverable should be viewable as a standard website. How you get there is up to you, though it's worth noting that we typically support a stack that uses technology such as PHP, node.js and React. We don't require you to write any form of server component but ask that you consider how you can ensure your submission will run effectively on any potential reviewers computer. 

## Review Criteria

All tech test submissions (for any of our tech tests) are anonymised and reviewed using a standard template.

At a high level we will be looking for:
* Clear instructions for how to run the application on a reviewer's machine
* Good understanding of the tasks undertaken and content presented in a clear, understandable format
* Well structured code
* High quality code that uses relevant design patterns
* Appropriate unit tests
* Security best practices applied
* Good understanding of errors and how to handle them

There's flexibility in the review process to take into account candidates who have strengths in different areas. Submissions that are very strong on visual design, UX and css are equally as valid as those which focus on the underlying code.

As mentioned previously, we aren't prescribing any specific languages, libraries or frameworks for the test but obviously the reviewer will need to take into account choices made in this area. For example, a submission using a technology like [create react app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) or [ember.js](https://www.emberjs.com/) will potentially offer a more complete set of tasks than one attempting to build everything from scratch. It is up to you to decide how pragmatic you wish to be. Make sure you choose an approach which you feel will show off your talents most effectively.

## Getting Started

### System Requirements

* Docker

### Running the API and Websocket Server

Full details of the API are available [on the docker hub page](https://hub.docker.com/r/sbgtechtest/api/). We would recommend running with `docker-compose up` so any logs from the API are visible in the terminal.


```bash
# running the basic image
docker run -it --rm --name sbg-tech-test-api -p 8888-8890:8888-8890 sbgtechtest/api

# running using docker compose
docker-compose up

# running using docker compose in the background
docker-compose up -d
```

The API will now be available on `http://localhost:8888/` and you should be able to view the available routes by hitting the API root.

The WebSocket Server will be available on `ws://localhost:8889` and you can test this is working by subscribing to all outcome updates:

```javascript
// In your browser's console add the following one line at a time
const w = new WebSocket("ws://localhost:8889");
w.addEventListener("message", m => console.log(JSON.parse(m.data)));
w.send(JSON.stringify({type: "subscribe", keys: ["o.*"]}));
```

See the documentation [on the docker hub page](https://hub.docker.com/r/sbgtechtest/api/) for full details of the WebSocket interface.
